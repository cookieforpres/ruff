# Ruff

## What is Ruff?

Ruff is a tool made in Rust to perform directory/file reconnaissance on a website. Just like [Gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster) or [Ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf), it can be used to find hidden directories and files on a website. *With subdomain support coming soon*.
